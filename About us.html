        <h1>BRAND STORY</h1>
        <p>
            Coined by Mr Xerxes Desai by marrying the words 'Tan' meaning body and 'Nishk' meaning a gold ornament, 
            Tanishq is a name synonymous with superior craftsmanship, exclusive designs and superlative product quality.
            A journey that started with the launch of 18K gold watches studded with precious stones, 
            Tanishq soon grew into a 22K gold jeweller who understood the evolving needs and desires of the Indian woman.
            A blend of traditional values coupled with a modern outlook made us 
            India's first and largest jewellery retail store chain and allows us to maintain our position as the top Indian jewellery brand.
        
            At Tanishq, jewellery is not a product, but rather,
            a manifestation of artistry and this is why we are a brand that has the distinct honour of being coveted by Indian women.

        <h1>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h1>
        <p>
            Quality is the crown jewel at Tanishq. From the craftsmen and designers,
            to their creations and the showrooms that sell them, 
            the highest level of quality checks are implemented to ensure unmatched perfection. 
            Deep rooted in our ethical beliefs and principles, Tanishq will never waver from our promises of purity,
            superior creations and to delight every worker and customer equally.

            Tanishq propagates legitimate sales and employment practices and strictly implements the PAN Card mandate, not just because we believe in the law but also because we believe in the spirit that the law was made in.
